	abstract = {Python is a simple, yet powerful, interpreted programming language that bridges the gap between C and shell programming, and is thus ideally suited for ``throw-away programming'' and rapid prototyping. Its syntax is put together from constructs borrowed from a variety of other languages; most prominent are influences from ABC, C, Modula-3 and Icon. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C.  Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX (including Linux), the Apple Macintosh O.S., MS-DOS, MS-Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and OS/2. This reference manual describes the syntax and ``core semantics'' of the language.  It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete. The semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in functions and modules are described in the Python Library Reference.  For an informal introduction to the language, see the Python Tutorial.},

	abstract = {The Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem (STSP) is a variant of the TSP that is particularly suitable when routing on real-life road networks. The standard integer programming formulations of both the TSP and STSP have an exponential number of constraints. On the other hand, several compact formulations of the TSP, i.e., formulations of polynomial size, are known. In this paper, we adapt some of them to the STSP, and compare them both theoretically and computationally. It turns out that, just by putting the best of the formulations into the CPLEX branch-and-bound solver, one can solve instances with over 200 nodes. We also briefly discuss the adaptation of our formulations to some related problems.},

SOCPs are nonlinear convex problems that include linear and (convex) quadratic programs as special cases, but are less general than semidefinite programs (SDPs). Several efficient primal-dual interior-point methods for SOCP have been developed in the last few years. After reviewing the basic theory of SOCPs, we describe general families of problems that can be recast as SOCPs. These include robust linear programming and robust least-squares problems, problems involving sums or maxima of norms, or with convex hyperbolic constraints. We discuss a variety of engineering applications, such as filter design, antenna array weight design, truss design, and grasping force optimization in robotics. We describe an efficient primal-dual interior-point method for solving SOCPs, which shares many of the features of primal-dual interior-point methods for linear programming (LP): Worst-case theoretical analysis shows that the number of iterations required to solve a problem grows at most as the square root of the problem size, while numerical experiments indicate that the typical number of iterations ranges between 5 and 50, almost independent of the problem size.},

We present a fast and exact planner for our mobile robot model, based upon recursive subdivision of a collision-free path generated by a lower-level geometric planner that ignores the motion constraints. The resultant trajectory is optimized to give a path that is of near-minimal length in its homotopy class. Our claims of high speed are supported by experimental results for implementations that assume a robot moving amid polygonal obstacles. The completeness and the complexity of the algorithm are proven using an appropriate metric in the configuration space R/sup 2//spl times/S/sup 1/ of the robot. This metric is defined by using the length of the shortest paths in the absence of obstacles as the distance between two configurations. We prove that the new induced topology and the classical one are the same. Although we concentrate upon the car-like robot, the generalization of these techniques leads to new theoretical issues involving sub-Riemannian geometry and to practical results for nonholonomic motion planning.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A path-planning algorithm for the classical mover's problem in three dimensions using a potential field representation of obstacles is presented. A potential function similar to the electrostatic potential is assigned to each obstacle, and the topological structure of the free space is derived in the form of minimum potential valleys. Path planning is done at two levels. First, a global planner selects a robot's path from the minimum potential valleys and its orientations along the path that minimize a heuristic estimate of the path length and the chance of collision. Then, a local planner modifies the path and orientations to derive the final collision-free path and orientations. If the local planner fails, a new path and orientations are selected by the global planner and subsequently examined by the local planner. This process is continued until a solution is found or there are no paths left to be examined. The algorithm solves a much wider class of problems than other heuristic algorithms and at the same time runs much faster than exact algorithms (typically 5 to 30 min on a Sun 3/260).{\textless}{\textgreater}},

This paper focuses on the algorithm that won both PTSP competitions: it takes advantage of the physics of the game to calculate the optimal order of waypoints, and it employs Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to drive the ship. The algorithm uses repetitions of actions (macro actions) to reduce the search space for navigation. Variations of this algorithm are presented and analyzed, in order to understand the strength of each one of its constituents and to comprehend what makes such an approach the best controller found so far for the PTSP.},

	abstract = {As the generalization of TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem), TSPN (TSP with Neighborhoods) is closely related to several important real-world applications. However, TSPN is significantly more challenging than TSP as it is inherently a mixed optimization task containing both combinatorial and continuous components. Different from previous studies where TSPN is either tackled by approximation algorithms or formulated as a mixed integer problem, we present a hybrid framework in which metaheuristics and classical TSP solvers are combined strategically to produce high quality solutions for TSPN with arbitrary neighborhoods. The most distinctive feature of our solution is that it imposes no explicit restriction on the shape and size of neighborhoods, while many existing TSPN solutions require the neighborhoods to be disks or ellipses. Furthermore, various continuous optimization algorithms and TSP solvers can be conveniently adopted as necessary. Experiment results show that, using two off-the-shelf routines and without any specific performance tuning efforts, our method can efficiently solve TSPN instances with up to 25 regions, which are represented by both convex and concave random polygons.},

This problem models the design of routes of drones or other vehicles that must visit a number of geographical elements to deliver some good or service and then move directly to the next using straight line displacements. We present two families of mathematical programming formulations. The first one is time-dependent and captures a number of characteristics of real applications at the price of using three indexes variables. The second family of formulations is not time-dependent, instead it uses connectivity properties to ensure the proper definition of routes. We compare them on a testbed of instances with different shapes of elements: second order cone (SOC) representable and polyhedral neighborhoods and polygonal chains. The computational results reported in this paper show that our models are useful and our formulations can solve to optimality medium size instances of sizes similar to other combinatorial problems including neighborhoods that have already been studied in the literature. To address larger instances we also present a heuristic algorithm that runs in two phases: clustering and Variable Neighborhood Search. This algorithm performs very well since it provides promising feasible solutions and, in addition, it can be used to initialize the solvers with feasible solutions.},

For the TSP on graphic metrics (graph-TSP), the approach yields a 1.461-approximation algorithm with respect to the Held-Karp lower bound. For graph-TSP restricted to a class of graphs that contains degree three bounded and claw-free graphs, we show that the integrality gap of the Held-Karp relaxation matches the conjectured ratio 4/3. The framework allows for generalizations in a natural way and also leads to a 1.586-approximation algorithm for the traveling salesman path problem on graphic metrics where the start and end vertices are prespecified.},
