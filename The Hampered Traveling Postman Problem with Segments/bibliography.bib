We present simple heuristic procedures for constructing tours, for a variety of neighborhood types, whose length is guaranteed to be within a constant factor of the length of an optimal tour. The neighborhoods we consider include parallel unit segments, translates of a polygonal region, and circles.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the close-enough traveling salesman problem, a variant of the Euclidean traveling salesman problem, in which the traveler visits a node if it passes through the neighborhood set of that node. We apply an effective strategy to discretize the neighborhoods of the nodes and the carousel greedy algorithm to appropriately select the neighborhoods that, step by step, are added to the partial solution until a feasible solution is generated. Our heuristic, based on these ingredients, is able to compute tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal solution relatively quickly. The computational results, carried out on benchmark instances, show that our heuristic often finds the optimal solution, on the instances where it is known, and in general, the upper bounds are more accurate than those from other algorithms available in the literature.Summary of Contribution: In this paper, we focus on the close-enough traveling salesman problem. This is a problem that has attracted research attention over the last 10 years; it has numerous real-world applications. For instance, consider the task of meter reading for utility companies. Homes and businesses have meters that measure the usage of gas, water, and electricity. Each meter transmits signals that can be read by a meter reader vehicle via radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology if the distance between the meter and the reader is less than r units. Each meter plays the role of a target point and the neighborhood is a disc of radius r centered at each target point. Now, suppose the meter reader vehicle is a drone and the goal is to visit each disc while minimizing the amount of energy expended by the drone. To solve this problem, we develop a metaheuristic approach, called (lb/ub)Alg, which computes both upper and lower bounds on the optimal solution value. This metaheuristic uses an innovative discretization scheme and the Carousel Greedy algorithm to obtain high-quality solutions. On benchmark instances where the optimal solution is known, (lb/ub)Alg obtains this solution 83\% of the time. Over the remaining 17\% of these instances, the deviation from the optimality is 0.05\%, on average. On the instances with the highest overlap ratio, (lb/ub)Alg does especially well.},

The standard integer programming formulations of both the TSP and STSP have an exponential number of constraints. On the other hand, several compact formulations of the TSP, i.e., formulations of polynomial size, are known. In this paper, we adapt some of them to the STSP, and compare them both theoretically and computationally. It turns out that, just by putting the best of the formulations into the CPLEX branch-and-bound solver, one can solve instances with over 200 nodes. We also briefly discuss the adaptation of our formulations to some related problems.},

SOCPs are nonlinear convex problems that include linear and (convex) quadratic programs as special cases, but are less general than semidefinite programs (SDPs). Several efficient primal-dual interior-point methods for SOCP have been developed in the last few years. After reviewing the basic theory of SOCPs, we describe general families of problems that can be recast as SOCPs. These include robust linear programming and robust least-squares problems, problems involving sums or maxima of norms, or with convex hyperbolic constraints. We discuss a variety of engineering applications, such as filter design, antenna array weight design, truss design, and grasping force optimization in robotics. We describe an efficient primal-dual interior-point method for solving SOCPs, which shares many of the features of primal-dual interior-point methods for linear programming (LP): Worst-case theoretical analysis shows that the number of iterations required to solve a problem grows at most as the square root of the problem size, while numerical experiments indicate that the typical number of iterations ranges between 5 and 50, almost independent of the problem size.},

Spatial coverage refers to the possibility of considering nodes that are not directly served by a vehicle as visited for the purpose of the objective function or constraints. Despite similarities between the underlying problems, solution approaches have been developed in different disciplines independently, leading to different terminologies and solution techniques. This paper proposes a unified view of the approaches: Based on a formal introduction of the concept of spatial coverage in vehicle routing, it presents a classification scheme for core problem features and summarizes problem variants and solution concepts developed in the domains of operations research and robotics. The connections between these related problem classes offer insights into common underlying structures and open possibilities for developing new applications and algorithms.},

This problem models the design of routes of drones or other vehicles that must visit a number of geographical elements to deliver some good or service and then move directly to the next using straight line displacements. We present two families of mathematical programming formulations. The first one is time-dependent and captures a number of characteristics of real applications at the price of using three indexes variables. The second family of formulations is not time-dependent, instead it uses connectivity properties to ensure the proper definition of routes. We compare them on a testbed of instances with different shapes of elements: second order cone (SOC) representable and polyhedral neighborhoods and polygonal chains. The computational results reported in this paper show that our models are useful and our formulations can solve to optimality medium size instances of sizes similar to other combinatorial problems including neighborhoods that have already been studied in the literature. To address larger instances we also present a heuristic algorithm that runs in two phases: clustering and Variable Neighborhood Search. This algorithm performs very well since it provides promising feasible solutions and, in addition, it can be used to initialize the solvers with feasible solutions.},

	abstract = {As the generalization of TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem), TSPN (TSP with Neighborhoods) is closely related to several important real-world applications. However, TSPN is significantly more challenging than TSP as it is inherently a mixed optimization task containing both combinatorial and continuous components. Different from previous studies where TSPN is either tackled by approximation algorithms or formulated as a mixed integer problem, we present a hybrid framework in which metaheuristics and classical TSP solvers are combined strategically to produce high quality solutions for TSPN with arbitrary neighborhoods. The most distinctive feature of our solution is that it imposes no explicit restriction on the shape and size of neighborhoods, while many existing TSPN solutions require the neighborhoods to be disks or ellipses. Furthermore, various continuous optimization algorithms and TSP solvers can be conveniently adopted as necessary. Experiment results show that, using two off-the-shelf routines and without any specific performance tuning efforts, our method can efficiently solve TSPN instances with up to 25 regions, which are represented by both convex and concave random polygons.},

In the fourth chapter, we develop a post-processor to improve the accuracy of our heuristics for solving the CETSP and CEVRP. In the fifth chapter, we solve the Sequence-Dependent Team Orienteering Problem (SDTOP) in which the profit received for each node visited is dependent on the sequence in which all the nodes are visited. We summarize the dissertation in the final chapter.   The CETSP, CEVRP, and SDTOP have application in aerial reconnaissance route planning. We formulate each problem as a mathematical program and apply heuristic and combinatorial optimization techniques to solve them.
